To create a Get Request that returns you info about a specific greeting, you need:

1. Create the Collection in Postman and the Get Request.
2. Create a new folder or package in the main folder that has the controller.
3. Create a new folder that has the entity or bean.
4. In the controller, the annotation @RestController will call the entity info and the request created in postman.
5. The @Autowired will be used to create by default a constructor with the getters and setters. Save code with this annotation.
6. The service is @GetMapping with the name of the request inside the parenthesis.
7. This service will return an entity info. That's why the method will be called as the Entity and has to return that as well.
8. After adding the attributes and methods of the entity, in the controller, we can set the info we want to show in the request.

NOTE: This is different when the JPA is included in the project (Controller, Repository, Service, ServiceImpl and Entity or Bean) are the difference 
between this simple greeting request and a JPA implementation.
