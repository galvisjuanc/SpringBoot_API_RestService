SETUP JPA Repository and its Mapping Beans

1. Create database and table to add the data from Service.
2. Define MySQL Properties in SpringBoot application-properties file.
3. Get JPA and MySQL Dependencies in POM.xml.
4. Create Mapping Entity Bean for the table which we need to map.
5. Define Repository Interface by extending JPARepository Interface.
6. Add JPA Hibernate Properties into application-properties file.
7. Understand CRUD operations of JPA Repository with example

MYSQL does not run automatically from DATAGRIP. It is neccesary to connect to localhost (also, that localhost needs
to be run before configuring the datasource in the IDE).
